## How it works

Aether integrates with current monitoring systems and some data sources in
order to **estimate** the emissions of your systems. The idea behind Aether
relies heavily on the idea of [Energy Proportionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_proportional_computing). In essence the higher
the utilization of hardware components, the energy consumption grows
Proportionally. Therefore Aether will pull key metrics from various
[Sources](./sources.md)
such as CPU Utilization, Memory Usage, Storage (coming soon) and Networking
(coming soon)


Due to the variability of cloud providers, each cloud provider works slightly
differently so please see the [sources](./sources.md) for more information on
the different source types
